Cascode Labs
============
Open source automation for the design of analog, mixed signal, and RF IC design


Goals
-----
- Advance the state of the art in analog and RF IC design automation.
- Encourage collaboration among designers with an interest in design automation
- Lower the barrier to entry for analog and RF design engineers with basic coding skills
- Develop analog and RF IC generators that can produce IP in multiple processes and adjust to variations in specifications.
- Get home in time for dinner every night

Packages
--------
A set of simple to install Conda EDA packages have been developed.  
Conda supports any language, including SKILL and Python. 

- skillbridge: Python to SKILL communication
- conda-virtuoso: SKILL package and environment management support using Conda
