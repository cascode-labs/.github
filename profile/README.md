Cascode Labs
============
Open source automation for the design of analog, mixed signal, and RF integrated circuits.

Goals
-----
- Advance the state of the art in analog and RF IC design automation.
- Encourage collaboration among designers
- Lower the barrier to entry for analog and RF design engineers with basic coding skills
- Develop analog and RF IC generators that can produce IP in multiple processes and adjust to variations in specifications.

Projects
--------
A set of simple to install Conda EDA packages are being developed.  
Conda supports any language, including SKILL and Python. 

- [viper](http://www.cascode-labs.org/viper/): Integrated circuit design environment supporting both free and commercial tools.
- [viper-forge](http://www.cascode-labs.org/viper-forge/): Community-led packages for IC design
- [virtue](http://www.cascode-labs.org/virtue/): Support for Cadence Virtuoso in Viper
