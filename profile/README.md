Cascode Labs
============
Open source automation for the design of analog, mixed signal, and RF integrated circuits.

Goals
-----
- Advance the state of the art in analog and RF IC design automation.
- Encourage collaboration among designers
- Lower the barrier to entry for analog and RF design engineers with basic coding skills
- Develop analog and RF IC generators that can produce IP in multiple processes and adjust to variations in specifications.

Projects
--------
The following set of projects are being created to support Viper.  See viper-forge for a list of projects with viper packages.

- [virtue](https://www.cascode-labs.org/virtue/): A SKILL and Python Framework for automating IC design in
[Cadence Virtuoso](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/custom-ic-analog-rf-design/circuit-design.html)
- [Softworks](https://github.com/cascode-labs/softworks):
  Software and documentation view types in the Cadence Virtuoso IC design environment.
- [Data-panels](https://github.com/cascode-labs/data-panels):
  Export rich data reports from simulation results to pptx slides and
  xlsx tables
- [Morpheus](https://github.com/cascode-labs/morpheus):
  Generate Maestro test benches in a standard way compatible with an associated
  data-panels report
- [viper](https://www.cascode-labs.org/viper/): Integrated circuit design environment supporting both free and commercial tools.
- [viper-forge](https://www.cascode-labs.org/viper-forge/): Community-led packages for IC design
